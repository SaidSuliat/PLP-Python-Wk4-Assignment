# 🖋️ File Read & Write + Error Handling Lab

Welcome to the **File Read & Write Challenge** and **Error Handling Lab**! 
## 📚 Description

This project consists of two main parts:

### 1. File Read & Write Challenge 🖋️
Create a program that:
- Reads the content from an existing file.
- Modifies the content in a specific way (e.g., converting to uppercase, removing whitespace, etc.).
- Writes the modified content to a **new** file.

### 2. Error Handling Lab 🧪
Enhance the program by:
- Prompting the user for a filename.
- Handling common file-related errors such as:
  - File not found
  - Permission denied
  - Empty filename
  - Unsupported file types (optional)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the program (e.g., `python main.py` if using Python).
3. When prompted, enter the filename you want to read.
4. The program will:
   - Attempt to open and read the file.
   - Modify its contents.
   - Write the results to a new file (e.g., `output.txt`).
5. If any errors occur (e.g., file doesn’t exist), you’ll see a helpful error message.

Happy coding! 🚀
